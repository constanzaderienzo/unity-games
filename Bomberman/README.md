### Game

The **Bomberman** game consists of a board made up of breakable and unbreakable walls. The objective is for the player to kill all enemies by dropping bombs and **then** advance to the next level by crossing the door.

An added difficulty is that the door is not visible at first sight, but rather hidden behind a breakable wall.

Bonuses exist one per level, also hidden behind a breakable wall, but the player is not required to find them in order to advance levels.

### Levels

**Creation:** Random
**Duration:** 200s

The levels contain a random disposition of breakable walls that range between 40 and 60, a random disposition of enemies and random disposition of both exit wall and bonus.
The amount of enemies increase with the level.
An additional consideration taken into account while placing the enemies was to avoid sudden death situations where the player began in a losing situation.
The player starts with 3 lives (it reads *LEFT 2*). A life is lost when:
*  An enemy collides with the player.
*  The time limit elapses.
*  The player collides with a bomb explosion.


### Enemies

All enemies move oscillating across one axis which changes after a random number of movements.

There are three types of enemies, which differ not only in appearence but in speed and points. As the levels progress, the more difficult enemies appear.
